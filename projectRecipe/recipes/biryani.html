    <h1>Delicious Biryani Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../assets/biryani.png" alt="Biryani Image" width="50%">
    <p>Biryani is a flavorful South Asian rice dish made with spiced meat or vegetables, fragrant basmati rice, and
        fresh herbs.</p>
    <p>It’s cooked slowly to blend all the rich flavors and is often served with raita or lemon for a
        refreshing touch.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 lb chicken or vegetables</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp biryani masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp red chili powder</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro and mint leaves</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ghee or oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice for 30 minutes, then
            drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken or vegetables and cook until they are partially done.</li>
        <li>Stir in the yogurt, biryani masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cook for a few minutes
            until the spices are well blended.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked and drained rice to the pot, mixing gently to combine with the meat/vegetable mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 20-25 minutes,
            or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
